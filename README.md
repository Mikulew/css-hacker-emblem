## General info

When you put **the glider emblem** on your web page, or wear it on clothing, or display it in some other way, you are visibly associating yourself with *the hacker culture*. This is not quite the same thing as claiming to be a hacker yourself â€” that is a title of honor that generally has to be conferred by others rather than self-assumed. But by using **this emblem**, you express sympathy with hackers' goals, hackers' values, and the hacker way of living.

## Technologies
